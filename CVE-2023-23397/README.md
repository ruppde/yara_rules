CSV of [samples](munin_check-results_CVE-2023-23397.csv) as of 17th Mar 2023 including the IPs the samples connect to. It looks like the attackers always used one distinct IP per victim (not included in CSV) but you still might want to check your firewall logs. The date of first submission can be used to check for false positives. Also check if the connection originated from an outlook.exe process, if you have these logs so long into the past.
